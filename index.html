            What can I do to make my connection faster?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Your Internet connection's maximum bandwidth is ultimately dictated by your ISP, but if you're not reaching that limit, there are a number of strategies
            you can employ to make your connection faster. Wireless signals can be improved by simply physically relocating closer to the access point.
            Better hardware can also improve signal and connection strength: an <a href="http://amzn.to/2nKnZGk" target="_blank">802.11 AC Wifi Router</a> or

                <li>Make sure the hotspot you are connecting to is secured - refer to your router's manual on how to set up a
                    password (using <b>WPA2</b> encryption, not WEP, which is unsafe). Unsecured networks can be accessed by just about anybody, clogging up available bandwidth.</li>
                <li>Restart your Wifi adapter by turning it on and off, or unplugging it and plugging it back in.
                <li>Restart your router manually by unplugging it and plugging it back in after 30 seconds. Sometimes routers

            If the control panel says something similar to "Searching for Server" or "First-time Setup", then your ISP is having issues.
            Consider <a href="http://gethuman.com/" target="_blank">giving them a call</a> to see if they are aware of connectivity problems on their end.
            A support number can be located on your latest internet bill. Otherwise, if the control panel page never loads (with no login
            prompt), and you're absolutely certain about the address, consider trying another router. This is
            rather time consuming, but can determine if your router is at fault or your ISP is at fault.

            If a brand new router fails to connect as well, the issue is likely due to your ISP and your router(s) are perfectly fine. If the new one connects, your

        <p class="question">I've tried everything above and I still don't have a stable connection!</p>
        <p class="answer">
            No amount of restarting and updating can make up for a poor quality connection provided by your ISP. Temporary setbacks are usually resolved within a day or two,
            but if you continue to experience regular disconnects, consider switching to a different ISP.
